An free open Source Password Generator that you can run local

Download all of the files (index.html , script.js, style.css)

Create a folder (you can choose your own name)

Set all files in that folder  (index.html , script.js, style.css)

Now click on the HTML file

Now it's opened in a browser and you can generate passwords locally

(Checking passwords can give wrong answers, so always use the password generator)
